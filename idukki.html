        Idukki (ഇടുക്കി) is a district in the Indian state of Kerala.[3] It was constituted on 26 January 1972, by splitting the district of Kottayam into two parts. Its division was previously headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Kuyilimala near Painavu and Cheruthoni in June 1976. Idukki district lies amid the Western Ghats of Kerala.
    
        Though it is the second-largest district in the region in terms of area, it has the lowest population density among the districts of Kerala.[4] The urban population is higher than the rural population. Idukki is rich in forests and thus is also known as the "Spice Garden of Kerala".
        
        Until 1998, when Kuttampuzha was added to Ernakulam district, Idukki was the largest district in Kerala.
        Idukki is one of the 14 districts of Kerala state, India, created on 26 January 1972. This beautiful High range district of Kerala is geographically known for its Mountainous Hills and Dense Forests. For the people of Kerala, Idukki is always associated with Power Generation. About 66% of the State’s Power needs come from the Hydroelectric Power Projects in Idukki.
        Idukki which lies in the Western Ghats of Kerala is the second largest district in area but has the lowest population density. Idukki has a vast forest reserve area; more than a half of the district is covered by forests. The urban areas are densely populated whereas villages are sparsely populated. Idukki is also known as the spice garden of Kerala.
