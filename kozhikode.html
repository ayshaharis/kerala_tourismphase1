Vasco Da Gama first set foot here in 1498 after which it became one of the most important ports in the Malabar region for the trade of spices, silk and other goods between European countries and India. The nature of land in Kozhikode is marshy. That is the reason why the world also knows Kozhikode as Chullikkad, which means a ‘shrubby jungle’. The friendly nature of the people of Kozhikode, along with their love for traditional values is heart touching.
        During classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, Kozhikode was dubbed the City of Spices for its role as the major trading point of Indian spices.[1] A historical city, it was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins) in the Middle Ages. According to data compiled by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2009 on residences, earnings and investments, Kozhikode ranked as the second best city in India to reside in. Also known as Calicut. During the British rule, Madras (now known as Chennai ) was the capital of the Malabar district which was part of the state. In ancient times it was known as the richest city in the world. Foreigners such as Arabs, Turks, Egyptians and Chinese traded here. The Zamorin ruled Kozhikode for a long time. Kozhikode district came into existence on 1 January 1957. The district covers an area of 28,79,131 km2 and consists of four taluks namely Vadakara, Koyilandy, Thamarassery and Kozhikode.
